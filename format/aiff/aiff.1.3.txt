The Audio Interchange File Format (Audio IFF) provides a standard for storing sampled sounds.
The format is quite flexible, allowing for the storage of monaural or multichannel sampled sounds
at a variety of sample rates and sample widths.
Audio IFF conforms to the "EA IFF 85" Standard for Interchange Format Files developed by
Electronic Arts.
Audio IFF is primarily an interchange format, although application designers should find it
flexible enough to use as a data storage format as well. If an application does choose to use a
different storage format, it should be able to convert to and from the format defined in this
document. This will facilitate the sharing of sound data between applications.
Audio IFF is the result of several meetings held with music developers over a period of ten
months in 1987-88. Apple Computer greatly appreciates the comments and cooperation provided
by all developers who helped define this standard.
Another "EA IFF 85" sound storage format is"8SVX" IFF 8-bit Sampled Voice, by Electronic
Arts. "8SVX", which handles 8-bit monaural samples, is intended mainly for storing sound for
playback on personal computers. Audio IFF is intended for use with a larger variety of
computers, sampled sound instruments, sound software applications, and high fidelity recording
devices.
Data types
A C-like language will be used to describe data structures in this document. The data types used
are listed below:
char: 8 bits, signed. A char can contain more than just ASCII characters. It
can contain any number from -128 to 127 (inclusive).
unsigned char: 8 bits, unsigned. Contains any number from zero to 255 (inclusive).
short: 16 bits, signed. Contains any number from -32,768 to 32,767 (inclusive).
unsigned short: 16 bits, unsigned. Contains any number from zero to 65,535 (inclusive).
long: 32 bits, signed. Contains any number from -2,147,483,648 to
2,147,483,647 (inclusive).
unsigned long: 32 bits, unsigned. Contains any number from zero to 4,294,967,295
(inclusive).
extended: 80 bit IEEE Standard 754 floating point number (Standard Apple
Numeric Environment [SANE] data type Extended).
pstring: Pascal-style string, a one byte count followed by text bytes. The total
number of bytes in this data type should be even. A pad byte can be
added at the end of the text to accomplish this. This pad byte is not
reflected in the count.
ID: 32 bits, the concatenation of four printable ASCII character in the range '
' (SP, 0x20) through '~' (0x7E). Spaces (0x20) cannot precede printing
characters; trailing spaces are allowed. Control characters are forbidden.
OSType: 32 bits. A concatenation of four characters, as defined in Inside
Macintosh, vol II.
Constants
Decimal values are referred to as a string of digits, for example 123, 0, 100 are all decimal
numbers. Hexadecimal values are preceded by a 0x - e.g. 0x0A12, 0x1, 0x64.
Data Organization
All data is stored in Motorola 68000 format. Data is organized as follows:
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
char msb lsb
msb lsb
15 14 13 1211 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
short byte 0 byte 1
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
msb
lsb
long byte 0 byte 1
byte 2 byte 3
15 14 13 1211 10 9 8
Referring to Audio IFF
The official name for this standard is Audio Interchange File Format. If an application program
needs to present the name of this format to a user, such as in a "Save as…" dialog box, the name
can be abbreviated to Audio IFF.
File Structure
The "EA IFF 85" Standard for Interchange Format Files defines an overall structure for storing
data in files. Audio IFF conforms to the "EA IFF 85" standard. This document will describe
those portions of "EA IFF 85" that are germane to Audio IFF. For a more complete discussion of
"EA IFF 85", please refer to the document "EA IFF 85" Standard for Interchange Format Files.
An "EA IFF 85" file is made up of a number of chunks of data. Chunks are the building blocks
of "EA IFF 85" files. A chunk consists of some header information followed by data:
A chunk.
ckID
ckSize
data
} header info
A chunk can be represented using our C-like language in the following manner:
typedef struct {
ID ckID; /* chunk ID */
long ckSize; /* chunk Size */
char ckData[]; /* data */
} Chunk;
ckID describes the format of the data portion a chunk. A program can determine how to
interpret the chunk data by examining ckID.
ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in bytes. It does not include the 8 bytes used
by ckID and ckSize.
ckData contains the data stored in the chunk. The format of this data is determined by ckID. If
the data is an odd number of bytes in length, a zero pad byte must be added at the end. The pad
byte is not included in ckSize .
Note that an array with no size specification (e.g. char ckData[];) indicates a variable-sized
array in our C-like language. This differs from standard C.
An Audio IFF file is a collection of a number of different types of chunks. There is a Common
Chunk which contains important parameters describing the sampled sound, such as it's length
and sample rate. There is a Sound Data Chunk that contains the actual audio samples. There are
several other optional chunks that define markers, list instrument parameters, store applicationspecific
information, etc. All of these chunks are described in detail in later sections of this
document.
The chunks in a Audio IFF file are grouped together in a container chunk. "EA IFF 85" defines a
number of container chunks, but the one used by Audio IFF is called a FORM. A FORM has the
following format:
typedef struct {
ID ckID;
long ckSize;
ID formType;
char chunks [];
} Chunk;
ckID is always 'FORM'. This indicates that this is a FORM chunk.
ckSize contains the size of data portion of the 'FORM' chunk. Note that the data portion has been
broken into two parts, formType and chunks[].
formType describes what's in the 'FORM' chunk. For Audio IFF files, formType is always 'AIFF'.
This indicates that the chunks within the FORM pertain to sampled sound. A FORM chunk of
formType 'AIFF' is called a FORM AIFF.
chunks are the chunks contained within the FORM. These chunks are called local chunks. A
FORM AIFF along with its local chunks make up an Audio IFF file.
Here is an example of a simple Audio IFF file. It consists of a file containing single FORM AIFF
which contains two local chunks, a Common Chunk and a Sound Data Chunk.
ckID = 'FORM'
ckID = 'COMM'
Common Chunk
ckID = 'SSND'
Sound Data Chunk
FORM AIFF Chunk
formType = 'AIFF'
There are no restrictions on the ordering of local chunks within a FORM AIFF.
On an Apple II, the FORM AIFF is stored in a ProDOS file. The file type is 0xD8 and the aux
type is 0x0000. AIFF versions 1.2 and earlier used file type 0xCB, which is incorrect. Please see
the Apple II File Type Note for file type 0xD8 and aux type 0x0000 for strategies on dealing with
this inconsistency.
On a Macintosh, the FORM AIFF is stored in the data fork of an Audio IFF file. The Macintosh
file type of an Audio IFF file is 'AIFF'. This is the same as the formType of the FORM AIFF.
Macintosh or Apple II applications should not store any information in Audio IFF file's resource
fork, as this information may not be preserved by all applications. Applications can use the
Application Specific Chunk, defined later in this document, to store extra information specific to
their application.
On an operating system that uses file extensions, such as MS-DOS or UNIX, it is recommended
that Audio IFF file names have a ".AIF" extension.
A more detailed example of an Audio IFF file can be found in Appendix A. Please refer to this
example as often as necessary while reading the remainder of this document.
Local Chunk Types
The formats of the different local chunk types found within a FORM AIFF are described in the
following sections. The ckIDs for each chunk are also defined.
There are two types of chunks, those that are required and those that are optional. The Common
Chunk is required. The Sound Data chunk is required if the sampled sound has greater than zero
length. All other chunks are optional. All applications that use FORM AIFF must be able to read
the required chunks, and can choose to selectively ignore the optional chunks. A program that
copies a FORM AIFF should copy all of the chunks in the FORM AIFF.
To insure that this standard remains usable by all developers, only Apple Computer, Inc. should
define new chunk types for FORM AIFF. If you have suggestions for new chunk types, Apple is
happy to listen! Please refer to Appendix B for instructions on how to send comments to Apple.
Common Chunk
The Common Chunk describes fundamental parameters of the sampled sound.
#define CommonID 'COMM' /* ckID for Common Chunk */
typedef struct {
ID ckID;
long ckSize;
short numChannels;
unsigned long numSampleFrames;
short sampleSize;
extended sampleRate;
} CommonChunk;
ckID is always 'COMM'. ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in bytes. It does not
include the 8 bytes used by ckID and ckSize. For the Common Chunk, ckSize is always 18.
numChannels contains the number of audio channels for the sound. A value of 1 means
monophonic sound, 2 means stereo, and 4 means four channel sound, etc. Any number of audio
channels may be represented.
The actual sound samples are stored in another chunk, the Sound Data Chunk, which will be
described shortly. For multichannel sounds, single sample points from each channel are
interleaved. A set of interleaved sample points is called a sample frame. This is illustrated below
for the stereo case.
frame 0 frame 1 frame N
ch 1 ch 2 ch 1 ch 2 • • • ch 1 ch 2
= one sample point
sample sample sample
For monophonic sound, a sample frame is a single sample point.
For multichannel sounds, the following conventions should be observed:
stereo
3 channel
4 channel
6 channel
channel
left right
left right center
center right surround
center right
1 2 3 4 5 6
left left right
center center surround
left
quad
front front rear rear
left right left right
numSampleFrames contains the number of sample frames in the Sound Data Chunk. Note that
numSampleFrames is the number of sample frames, not the number of bytes nor the number of
sample points in the Sound Data Chunk. The total number of sample points in the file is
numSampleFrames times numChannels.
sampleSize is the number of bits in each sample point. It can be any number from 1 to 32. The
format of a sample point will be described in the next section, the Sound Data Chunk.
sampleRate is the sample rate at which the sound is to be played back, in sample frames per
second.
One and only one Common Chunk is required in every FORM AIFF.
Sound Data Chunk
The Sound Data Chunk contains the actual sample frames.
#define SoundDataID 'SSND' /* ckID for Sound Data Chunk */
typedef struct {
ID ckID;
long ckSize;
unsigned long offset;
unsigned long blockSize;
unsigned char soundData[];
} SoundDataChunk;
ckID is always 'SSND'. ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in bytes. It does not
include the 8 bytes used by ckID and ckSize.
offset determines where the first sample frame in the soundData starts. offset is in bytes. Most
applications won't use offset and should set it to zero. Use for a non-zero offset is explained in the
Block-Aligning Sound Data section below.
blockSize is used in conjunction with offset for block-aligning sound data. It contains the size in
bytes of the blocks that sound data is aligned to. As with offset, most applications won't use
blockSize and should set it to zero. More information on blockSize is in the Block-Aligning Sound
Data section below.
soundData contains the sample frames that make up the sound. The number of sample frames in
the soundData is determined by the numSampleFrames parameter in the Common Chunk.
Sample Points
Each sample point in a sample frame is a linear, 2's complement value. The sample points are
from 1 to 32 bits wide, as determined by the sampleSize parameter in the Common Chunk.
Sample points are stored in an integral number of contiguous bytes. One to 8 bit wide sample
points are stored in one byte, 9 to 16 bit wide sample points are stored in two bytes, 17 to 24 bit
wide sample points are stored in 3 bytes, and 25 to 32 bit wide samples are stored in 4 bytes.
When the width of a sample point is less than a multiple of 8 bits, the sample point data is left
justified, with the remaining bits zeroed. An example case is illustrated below. A 12 bit sample
point, binary 101000010111, is stored left justified in two bytes. The remaining bits are set to
zero.
12 bit sample point
is left justified 4 bits are
zero padded
right most
1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
Sample Frames
Sample frames are stored contiguously in order of increasing time. The sample points within a
sample frame are packed together, there are no unused bytes between them. Likewise, the sample
frames are packed together with no pad bytes.
Block-Aligning Sound Data
There may be some applications that, to insure real time recording and playback of audio, wish to
align sampled sound data with fixed-size blocks. This can be accomplished with the offset and
blockSize parameters, as shown below.
Block-aligned sound data
numSampleFrames sample frames
block N - 1 block N block N + 1 block N + 2
unused sample frames unused
offset
bytes
soundData[]
blockSize bytes
In the above figure, the first sample frame starts at the beginning of block N. This is
accomplished by skipping the first offset bytes of the soundData. Note too that the soundData
array can extend beyond valid sample frames, allowing the soundData array to end on a block
boundary.
blockSize specifies the size in bytes of the block that is to be aligned to. A blockSize of zero
indicates that the sound data does not need to be block-aligned. Applications that don't care about
block alignment should set blockSize and offset to zero when writing Audio IFF files.
Applications that write block-aligned sound data should set blockSize to the appropriate block
size. Applications that modify an existing Audio IFF file should try to preserve alignment of the
sound data, although this is not required. If an application doesn't preserve alignment, it should
set blockSize and offset to zero. If an application needs to realign sound data to a different sized
block, it should update blockSize and offset accordingly.
The Sound Data Chunk is required unless the numSampleFrames field in the Common Chunk is
zero. A maximum of one Sound Data Chunk can appear in a FORM AIFF.
Marker Chunk
The Marker Chunk contains markers that point to positions in the sound data. Markers can be
used for whatever purposes an application desires. The Instrument Chunk, defined later in this
document, uses markers to mark loop beginning and end points, for example.
Markers
A marker has the following format.
typedef short MarkerId;
typedef struct {
MarkerId id;
unsigned long position;
pstring markerName;
} Marker;
id is a number that uniquely identifies the marker within a FORM AIFF. The id can be any
positive non-zero integer, as long as no other marker within the same FORM AIFF has the same
id.
The marker's position in the sound data is determined by position . Markers conceptually fall
between two sample frames. A marker that falls before the first sample frame in the sound data is
at position zero, while a marker that falls between the first and second sample frame in the sound
data is at position 1. Note that the units for position are sample frames, not bytes nor sample
points.
position 0 position 5 position 12
Sample Frames
markerName is a Pascal-style text string containing the name of the mark.
Note: Some "EA IFF 85" files store strings as C-strings (text bytes followed by a null terminating
character) instead of Pascal-style strings. Audio IFF uses pstrings because they are more
efficiently skipped over when scanning through chunks. Using pstrings, a program can skip
over a string by adding the string count to the address of the first character. C strings require that
each character in the string be examined for the null terminator.
Marker Chunk Format
The format for the data within a Marker Chunk is shown below.
#define MarkerID 'MARK' /* ckID for Marker Chunk */
typedef struct {
ID ckID;
long ckSize;
unsigned short numMarkers;
Marker Markers[];
} MarkerChunk;
ckID is always 'MARK'. ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in bytes. It does not
include the 8 bytes used by ckID and ckSize.
numMarkers is the number of markers in the Marker Chunk.
numMarkers, if non-zero, it is followed by the markers themselves. Because all fields in a
marker are an even number of bytes in length, the length of any marker will always be even.
Thus, markers are packed together with no unused bytes between them. The markers need not be
ordered in any particular manner.
The Marker Chunk is optional. No more than one Marker Chunk can appear in a FORM AIFF.
Instrument Chunk
The Instrument Chunk defines basic parameters that an instrument, such as a sampler, could use
to play back the sound data.
Looping
Sound data can be looped, allowing a portion of the sound to be repeated in order to lengthen the
sound. The structure below describes a loop:
typedef struct {
short playMode;
MarkerId beginLoop;
MarkerId endLoop;
} Loop;
A loop is marked with two points, a begin position and an end position. There are two ways to
play a loop, forward looping and forward/backward looping. In the case of forward looping,
playback begins at the beginning of the sound, continues past the begin position and continues to
the end position, at which point playback restarts again at the begin position. The segment
between the begin and end positions, called the loop segment, is played over and over again, until
interrupted by something, such as the release of a key on a sampling instrument, for example.
begin position end position
sample frames loop segment
With forward/backward looping, the loop segment is first played from the begin position to the
end position, and then played backwards from the end position back to the begin position. This
flip-flop pattern is repeated over and over again until interrupted.
playMode specifies which type of looping is to be performed.
#define NoLooping 0
#define ForwardLooping 1
#define ForwardBackwardLooping 2
If NoLooping is specified, then the loop points are ignored during playback.
beginLoop is a the marker id that marks the begin position of the loop segment.
endLoop marks the end position of a loop. The begin position must be less than the end position.
If this is not the case, then the loop segment has zero or negative length and no looping takes
place.
Instrument Chunk Format
The format of the data within an Instrument Chunk is described below.
#define InstrumentID 'INST' /* ckID for Instrument Chunk */
typedef struct {
ID ckID;
long ckSize;
char baseNote;
char detune;
char lowNote;
char highNote;
char lowVelocity;
char highVelocity;
short gain;
Loop sustainLoop;
Loop releaseLoop;
} InstrumentChunk;
ckID is always 'INST'. ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in bytes. For the
Instrument Chunk, ckSize is always 20.
baseNote is the note at which the instrument plays back the sound data without pitch
modification. Units are MIDI (MIDI is an acronym for Musical Instrument Digital Interface)
note numbers, and are in the range 0 through 127. Middle C is 60.
detune determines how much the instrument should alter the pitch of the sound when it is played
back. Units are in cents (1/100 of a semitone) and range from -50 to +50. Negative numbers
mean that the pitch of the sound should be lowered, while positive numbers mean that it should be
raised.
lowNote and highNote specify the suggested range on a keyboard for playback of the sound data.
The sound data should be played if the instrument is requested to play a note between the low and
high notes, inclusive. The base note does not have to be within this range. Units for lowNote
and highNote are MIDI note values.
lowVelocity and highVelocity specify the suggested range of velocities for playback of the sound
data. The sound data should be played if the note-on velocity is is between low and high velocity,
inclusive. Units are MIDI velocity values, 1 (lowest velocity) through 127 (highest velocity).
gain is the amount by which to change the gain of the sound when it is played. Units are
decibels. For example, 0 db means no change, 6 db means double the value of each sample point,
while -6 db means halve the value of each sample point.
sustainLoop specifies a loop that is to be played when an instrument is sustaining a sound.
releaseLoop specifies a loop that is to be played when an instrument is in the release phase of
playing back a sound. The release phase usually occurs after a key on an instrument is released.
The Instrument Chunk is optional. No more than one Instrument Chunk can appear in a FORM
AIFF.
MIDI Data Chunk
The MIDI Data Chunk can be used to store MIDI data (please refer to Musical Instrument Digital
Interface Specification 1.0, available from the International MIDI Association, for more details on
MIDI).
The primary purpose of this chunk is to store MIDI System Exclusive messages, although other
types of MIDI data can be stored in this block as well. As more instruments come on the market,
they will likely have parameters that have not been included in the Audio IFF specification. The
MIDI System Exclusive messages for these instruments may contain many parameters that are
not included in the Instrument Chunk. For example, a new sampling instrument may have more
than the two loops defined in the Instrument Chunk. These loops will likely be represented in the
MIDI System Exclusive message for the new machine. This MIDI System Exclusive message
can be stored in the MIDI Data Chunk.
#define MIDIDataID 'MIDI' /* ckID for MIDI Data Chunk */
typedef struct {
ID ckID;
long ckSize;
unsigned char MIDIdata[];
} MIDIDataChunk;
ckID is always ' MIDI'. ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in bytes. It does not
include the 8 bytes used by ckID and ckSize.
MIDIData contains a stream of MIDI data.
The MIDI Data Chunk is optional. Any number of MIDI Data Chunks may exist in a FORM
AIFF. If MIDI System Exclusive messages for several instruments are to be stored in a FORM
AIFF, it is better to use one MIDI Data Chunk per instrument than one big MIDI Data Chunk for
all of the instruments.
Audio Recording Chunk
The Audio Recording Chunk contains information pertinent to audio recording devices.
#define AudioRecordingID 'AESD' /* ckID for Audio Recording */
/* Chunk. */
typedef struct {
ID ckID;
long ckSize;
unsigned char AESChannelStatusData[24];
} AudioRecordingChunk;
ckID is always 'AESD'. ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in bytes. For the
Audio Recording Chunk, ckSize is always 24.
The 24 bytes of AESChannelStatusData are specified in the AES Recommended Practice for
Digital Audio Engineering - Serial Transmission Format for Linearly Represented Digital Audio
Data, section 7.1, Channel Status Data. That document describes a format for real-time digital
transmission of digital audio between audio devices. This information is duplicated in the Audio
Recording Chunk for convenience. Of general interest would be bits 2, 3, and 4 of byte 0, which
describe recording emphasis.
The Audio Recording Chunk is optional. No more than one Audio Recording Chunk may appear
in a FORM AIFF.
Application Specific Chunk
The Application Specific Chunk can be used for any purposes whatsoever by manufacturers of
applications. For example, an application that edits sounds might want to use this chunk to store
editor state parameters such as magnification levels, last cursor position, and the like.
#define ApplicationSpecificID 'APPL' /* ckID for Application */
/* Specific Chunk. */
typedef struct {
ID ckID;
long ckSize;
OSType applicationSignature;
char data[];
} ApplicationSpecificChunk;
ckID is always 'APPL'. ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in bytes. It does not
include the 8 bytes used by ckID and ckSize.
applicationSignature identifies a particular application. For Macintosh applications, this will be
the application's four character signature. For Apple II applications, applicationSignature should
always be 'pdos', or the hexadecimal bytes 0x70646F73. If applicationSignature is 'pdos', the
beginning of the data area is defined to be a Pascal-style string (a length byte followed by ASCII
string bytes) containing the name of the application. This is necessary because Apple II
applications do not have a four-byte signature as do Macintosh applications.
data is the data specific to the application.
The Application Specific Chunk is optional. Any number of Application Specific Chunks may
exist in a single FORM AIFF.
Comments Chunk
The Comments Chunk is used to store comments in the FORM AIFF. "EA IFF 85" has an
Annotation Chunk that can be used for comments, but the Comments Chunk has two features not
found in the "EA IFF 85" chunk. They are: 1) a timestamp for the comment; and 2) a link to a
marker.
Comment
A comment consists of a time stamp, marker id, and a text count followed by text.
typedef struct {
unsigned long timeStamp;
MarkerID marker;
unsigned short count;
char text;
} Comment;
timeStamp indicates when the comment was created. Units are the number of seconds since
January 1, 1904. (This time convention is the one used by the Macintosh. For procedures that
manipulate the time stamp, see The Operating System Utilities chapter in Inside Macintosh, vol II
). For a routine that will convert this to an Apple II GS/OS format time, please see Apple II File
Type Note for filetype 0xD8, aux type 0x0000.
A comment can be linked to a marker. This allows applications to store long descriptions of
markers as a comment. If the comment is referring to a marker, then marker is the ID of that
marker. Otherwise, marker is zero, indicating that this comment is not linked to a marker.
count is the length of the text that makes up the comment. This is a 16 bit quantity, allowing
much longer comments than would be available with a pstring.
text contains the comment itself. This text must be padded with a byte at the end to insure that it
is an even number of bytes in length. This pad byte, if present, is not included in count.
Comments Chunk Format
#define CommentID 'COMT' /* ckID for Comments Chunk. */
typedef struct {
ID ckID;
long ckSize;
unsigned short numComments;
Comment comments[];
} CommentsChunk;
ckID is always ' COMT'. ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in bytes. It does not
include the 8 bytes used by ckID and ckSize.
numComments contains the number of comments in the Comments Chunk. This is followed by
the comments themselves. Comments are always an even number of bytes in length, so there is
no padding between comments in the Comments Chunk.
The Comments Chunk is optional. No more than one Comments Chunk may appear in a single
FORM AIFF.
Text Chunks - Name, Author, Copyright, Annotation
These four chunks are included in the definition of every "EA IFF 85" file. All are text chunks;
their data portion consists solely of text. Each of these chunks is optional.
#define NameID 'NAME' /* ckID for Name Chunk. */
#define AuthorID 'AUTH' /* ckID for Author Chunk. */
#define CopyrightID '(c) ' /* ckID for Copyright Chunk. */
#define AnnotationID 'ANNO' /* ckID for Annotation Chunk. */
typedef struct {
ID ckID;
long ckSize;
char text[];
} TextChunk;
ckID is either ' NAME', ' AUTH', '(c) ', or ' ANNO', depending on whether the chunk as a Name
Chunk, Author Chunk, Copyright Chunk, or Annotation Chunk, respectively. For the Copyright
Chunk, the 'c' is lowercase and there is a space (0x20) after the close parenthesis.
ckSize is the size of the data portion of the chunk, in this case the text.
text contains pure ASCII characters. It is not a pstring nor a C string. The number of
characters in text is determined by ckSize. The contents of text depend on the chunk, as described
below:
Name Chunk
text contains the name of the sampled sound. The Name Chunk is optional. No more than one
Name Chunk may exist within a FORM AIFF.
Author Chunk
text contains one or more author names. An author in this case is the creator of a sampled sound.
The Author Chunk is optional. No more than one Author Chunk may exist within a FORM AIFF.
Copyright Chunk
The Copyright Chunk contains a copyright notice for the sound. text contains a date followed by
the copyright owner. The chunk ID '(c) ' serves as the copyright characters '©'. For example, a
Copyright Chunk containing the text "1988 Apple Computer, Inc." means "© 1988 Apple
Computer, Inc."
The Copyright Chunk is optional. No more than one Copyright Chunk may exist within a FORM
AIFF.
Annotation Chunk
text contains a comment. Use of this chunk is discouraged within FORM AIFF. The more
powerful Comments Chunk should be used instead. The Annotation Chunk is optional. Many
Annotation Chunks may exist within a FORM AIFF.
Chunk Precedence
Several of the local chunks for FORM AIFF may contain duplicate information. For example, the
Instrument Chunk defines loop points and MIDI system exclusive data in the MIDI Data Chunk
may also define loop points. What happens if these loop points are different? How is an
application supposed to loop the sound?
Such conflicts are resolved by defining a precedence for chunks:
Common Chunk
Sound Data Chunk
Marker Chunk
Instrument Chunk
Highest Precedence
Application Specific Chunk Lowest Precedence
MIDI Data Chunk
Audio Recording Chunk
Comment Chunk
Name Chunk
Author Chunk
Copyright Chunk
Annotation Chunk
The Common Chunk has the highest precedence, while the Application Specific Chunk has the
lowest. Information in the Common Chunk always takes precedence over conflicting information
in any other chunk. The Application Specific Chunk always loses in conflicts with other chunks.
By looking at the chunk hierarchy, for example, one sees that the loop points in the Instrument
Chunk take precedence over conflicting loop points found in the MIDI Data Chunk.
It is the responsibility of applications that write data into the lower precedence chunks to make
sure that the higher precedence chunks are updated accordingly.
Appendix A - An Example
Illustrated below is an example of a FORM AIFF. An Audio IFF file is simply a file containing a
